  # Maps this person to a CommitteeMember record if a valid token is sent with the URL. Note that EXPo always uses the rule that
  # "the person knows him or herself the best," so when mapping a person to a CommitteeMember, we completely disconnect from the
  # Person that was originally connected to this CommitteeMember. So if a staff person adds a new CommitteeMember to this Committee
  # (along with a new person) and says that the person's name is "Bob Smith" and then the user logs in using one of these mapped URLs
  # and the user's Person record says that his name is "Michael Jordan" we're going to trust the user and the CommitteeMember would
  # now be connected to the Michael Jordan Person record. This means that on the admin side, that Bob Smith CommitteeMember would suddenly
  # change to Michael Jordan without warning. This could potentially cause problems at some point, so this method should be revisited.
