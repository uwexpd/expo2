<h1>Would you like a printed copy of the <em>Proceedings</em>?</h1>

<p>All undergraduate presenters and guests will receive a copy of the Symposium <em>Program</em> at the event (schedule, session information, and presenters, but NOT abstracts) and will be able to access an online copy of the <em>Proceedings</em> (which includes all student abstracts). In the past we have also provided a printed copy of the <em>Proceedings</em> on Symposium Day.  However, in the interest of conserving resources, we are asking if you would like to receive a printed copy.</p>
 
<p>If you wish to receive a printed copy of the <em>Proceedings</em>, please reserve one by Friday, April 24th by clicking below.</p>
