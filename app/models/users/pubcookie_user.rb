Authenticates a user by their login name without a password.  Returns the user if found.  If we don't find a user record, we create one.In some cases, a single UWNetID needs to have multiple associated user accounts. For example, if a staff member is an alumnus (and therefore has a student record as well) or a graduate student serves as a mentor, we need to be able to distinguish between these different "identities" of the same person. Therefore, self#authenticate can be passed +require_identity+, which is an identity type that that user must authenticate as. If +require_identity+ is not passed, the PubcookieUser will _always_ be authenticated as a generic User and will not have access to a student record. If "Student" is passed as the required_identity, the User will be authenticated as a Student if a StudentRecord is found or as a generic Person if a StudentRecord cannot be found. For this reason, it is possible for there to be multiple Users with the same login, as long as the login is unique within the scope of the User's +identity_type+.
