# Each ApplicationForOffering object can have multiple ApplicationFiles attached to it.  In many cases this will be in the form of an actual attached file, such as a Word document, a PDF, or an image.  In some cases, the "file" will be stored as plain text, such as a simple letter or a student's essay that needs to be easily transferred or indexed; this is the purpose of the +text_version+ attribute.
