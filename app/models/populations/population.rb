# A Population defines a group of objects that can be compared or reported on elsewhere in EXPO. A Population is defined by selecting a starting object, defined by the "populatable" relationship. Within that, you select the "starting set" of objects to use, which will link to a has_many relationship in the starting object. Finally, a number of PopulationConditions are added on to the Population definition to further refine the selection of individual objects for inspection.
# 
# == Attributes
# The attributes are as follows:
# 
# *  +title+: The title of the Population. Required.
# *  +description+: A brief description, if desired.
# *  +populatable+: The starting object to use. Required.
# *  +starting_set+: The name of the relationship or method in the starting object that will return an array of objects as a starting point. Required.
# *  +condition_operator+: Defines how to compare the conditions. "any" will find objects in the starting set that meet any of the conditions; "all" will require that objects meet every condition. Default is "all".
# *  +access_level+: Default is creator.
#    * everyone - any user will see this population in lists
#    * unit - other users in the population creator's unit will see this population in lists
#    * creator (or blank) - only the creator of the population will be shown it.
# 
# == System Populations
# A population can be created by the system (instead of by a user) and marked with the +system?+ boolean. These populations
# do not show up in lists of populations until a user saves them manually.
