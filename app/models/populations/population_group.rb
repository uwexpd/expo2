# Allows a user to group many Population objects (or other PopulationGroup objects) together for combined reporting. This can be useful for consolidating populations together (e.g., "2009 Mary Gates Scholars" could include scholarship winners from Autumn, Winter, and Spring 2009) or comparing populations in reporting (e.g., compare the demographic changes between the three quarters of 2009 Mary Gates Scholars).
