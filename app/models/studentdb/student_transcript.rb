# (No description in UWSDB Data Warehouse.)  Contains one record per quarter that a student completed (or simply enrolled in?) courses at the UW.  Contains information about credits attempted, grade points earned, etc.  A collection of StudentTranscript objects makes up a student's full transcript.  Transcript information is sequential and must be displayed in proper order so that calculations (e.g., cumulative GPA) make sense.
