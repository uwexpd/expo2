# The StudentRecord entity (UWSDB.student_1_v) contains attributes of the student (person) pursuing an officially recognized course of learning at the University of Washington. Student_1 displays the SDB's most current information on a student. The student_1 entity is SDB's closest approximation of a "person." [Unified Definition of Student here, 2001] -- Anyone with a system_key-bearing record in SDB has a student_1 record.
