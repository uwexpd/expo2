# Models a course identified in the Student DB Time Schedule.
# 
# The course can have _registrants_ and _extra_enrollees_. Extra enrollees are Students who have been identified by program staff as being enrolled in this Course. This is useful because our copy of the Student DB has a 24-hour delay, so if a student registers for a course and then tries to immediately register for a service learning opportunity (for instance), EXPo will not show them as a registrant.
