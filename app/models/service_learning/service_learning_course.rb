# A ServiceLearningCourse is any group that is eligible to sign up for a ServiceLearningPosition. This is most often an official course (with a record in the SDB Time Schedule), but could also be an "unoffical" course (such as an Extension course or other course that does not appear in the Time Schedule), a program (such as the Pipeline Project, which sometimes hosts a few service learning groups), or simply another group of individuals who are participating in Service Learning. As a result, the term "Course" might be somewhat misleading for certain instances of this Model.
# 
# ServiceLearningCourses also each have many ServiceLearningCourseInstructors. Since the instructor data in the SDB is unreliable, we maintain this list on our own. This also allows us to track additional course instructors or TA's, both of which are often not listed in the SDB.
# 
# Finally, a ServiceLearningCourse has a ServiceLearningCourseStatus which is used during the Course Development process. See notes at ServiceLearningCourseStatus.
