=begin rdoc
  Models a type of Service Learning opportunity for which a student can volunteer. Each position can have multiple ServiceLearningPlacements, or slots that are allocated to different classes and then reserved by a student.
  
  A ServiceLearningPosition belongs to an OrganizationQuarter, which links the position to a specific Quarter and Organization that is sponsoring the position. A position can also belong to another ServiceLearningPosition which is called the "previous" position, which allows us to link a position to its counterpart from a previous quarter. Since position details change significantly from Quarter to Quarter and they do not need a "parent" entity, this gives us enough information to show all previous related positions, even if the title or other significant detail has changed (e.g., "Database Assistant" changes to "Database Wizard" -- a wording change, but not really a significant change).
  
==Pipeline Positions
Pipeline Positions are ServiceLearningPositions that have the pipeline unit attached.
By default the Positions don't use slots, the slots are created and destroyed when a student is added.
To have a Pipeline Position use slots like a service learning position you have to set the flag 'uses_slots?' to true.
 - USE: This would be used if the position is for a specific course you can set it to use slots and then
   only create slots for that course.

Pipeline Courses are ServiceLearningCourses that have the pipeline unit.
  With a Pipeline Course the positions matches by default are set by using the filters.
  To have a Pipeline Course act like a service learning course you can set the 'no_filters' flag
  With the 'no_filters' flag set the course will only use positions that have slots for it, also the positions do not have to be set to 'uses_slots?'
  USE: This would be used for a course like the refugee seminar, where the positions for the course might not have any position attributes so you can then force the course to use the positions that have slots for the course

ServiceLearningPositions now have a many to many relationships to:
  pipeline_positions_subjects
  pipeline_positions_tutoring_types
  pipeline_positions_grade_levels
  
How a person is classified a volunteer:
  Attended an orientation and they are not in a pipeline course for the quarter you are comparing against
  Have a placement for the quarter and that placements course is NULL

How a person is considered an active pipeline volunteer
  pipeline_orientation <= 2 years old
  pipeline_background_check <= 2 years old
  pipeline_inactive != true

Students can only confirm positions for the current quarter.
  The confirm position method should not ever be reached for the non current quarter.
  The non current quarter should say "you can not confirm positions for this quarter" in last info box.
  Checks in PipelineController.confirm_position (incase it is reached).
  PipelineController.confirm_position  is the only method used by students to confirm positions.

ServiceLearningCourses now have a students field. The students field is a serialized hash of the students in the course.
  A 'sweeper' was added called ServiceLearningCourseSweeper it has the function self.update_students(quarter(s)) that updates the students field for all ow the courses for the passed quarter(s)
  Current Format: {Student.id=>{:course_id=>ServiceLearningCourseCourse.id}}  

ServiceLearningCourses also have one pipeline_course_filter
  It is a serialized list of filters set on the admin side
  This allows you to apply filters to a service learning course from that admin side that are forced on the student side
