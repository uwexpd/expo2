# Any object within EXPo can be notated with a Note. Note accepts a polymorphic association called +notable+ that can be used to add notes to another model.
# 
# A note can have different access levels (determined by the +access_level+ attribute):
# 
# * everyone (or blank) - any admin user can see the note
# * unit - other users in the note creator's unit can see the note
# * creator - only the creator of the note can see it
