An Activity models a person's participation in some sort of trackable activity. The primary purpose of the Activity models is to compile and generate accountability statistics for the provost and the legislature. We currently focus on two metrics for undergraduates: public service and research.

== How activities are stored
Activity is subclassed by a number of Activity varieties:

ActivityCourse::    for tracking an entire UW course for a particular quarter
ActivityProject::   for tracking an ongoing project, such as Students in Service, that lasts several weeks or even several quarters
ActivityEvent::     for tracking a one-time event, such as the MLK Day of Service, that has a more limited scope.
